# PurpleSpawner - Minecraft Spigot Plugin

**PurpleSpawner** is a lightweight Spigot plugin developed for **Minecraft 1.18**, allowing server admins or map makers to create **custom entity spawners via simple commands**. Whether you want zombies riding bees or an endless stream of creepers, this plugin gives you full control over what spawns and where.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This project is **fairly old** and was created during the time of Spigot **1.18**. The code may not reflect modern coding practices or best design patterns. If developed today, many parts of it would likely be implemented differently.
